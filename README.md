# self hosted chat gpt

simple proof-of-concept to have chat gpt running in a react app quickly.
backend is in Go because I don't like using javascript as a backend.

Running the app:
```bash
go run . -h   # start backend in one terminal (it is a cli app, read instructions)
yarn start    # start frontend in another terminal
```
